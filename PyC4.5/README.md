# PyC4.5

A Python implementation of the C4.5 Machine Learning Algorithm.

Uses the `Panda` library for all the DataFrames and Data Representation and `NumPy` to help with numerical representations of it. The implementation of the algorithm works with multiple datasets, and test datasets are present for [HCV Datast](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HCV+data).
