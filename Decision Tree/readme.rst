Decision Tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents feature(or attribute), the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. The topmost node in a decision tree is known as the root node. It learns to partition on the basis of the attribute value. It partitions the tree in recursively manner call recursive partitioning. This flowchart-like structure helps you in decision making. It's visualization like a flowchart diagram which easily mimics the human level thinking. That is why decision trees are easy to understand and interpret.

Decision Tree using data set [hacvdat0](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HCV+data)
Jupyter is used for implementing. Scikit-learn is used for plotting the tree


Scikit-learn plotting capabilities (i.e., functions start with ``plot_`` and
classes end with "Display") require Matplotlib (>= |MatplotlibMinVersion|).
For running the examples Matplotlib >= |MatplotlibMinVersion| is required.
A few examples require scikit-image >= |Scikit-ImageMinVersion|, a few examples
require pandas >= |PandasMinVersion|, some examples require seaborn >=
|SeabornMinVersion|.

User installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you already have a working installation of numpy and scipy,
the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using ``pip``   ::

    pip install -U scikit-learn

or ``conda``::

    conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn

The documentation includes more detailed `installation instructions <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html>`_.
Changelog
---------

for a history of notable changes to scikit-learn.

Development
-----------

We welcome new contributors of all experience levels. The scikit-learn
community goals are to be helpful, welcoming, and effective. The
`Development Guide <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/index.html>`_
has detailed information about contributing code, documentation, tests, and
more. We've included some basic information in this README.

Testing
~~~~~~~

After installation, you can launch the test suite from outside the source
directory (you will need to have ``pytest`` >= |PyTestMinVersion| installed)::

    pytest sklearn

See the web page https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/advanced_installation.html#testing
for more information.

    Random number generation can be controlled during testing by setting
    the ``SKLEARN_SEED`` environment variable.
